  abstract={We present PLONQ, a progressive neural image compression scheme which pushes the boundary of variable bitrate compression by allowing quality scalable coding with a single bitstream. In contrast to existing learned variable bitrate solutions which produce separate bitstreams for each quality, it enables easier rate-control and requires less storage. Leveraging the latent scaling based variable bitrate solution, we introduce nested quantization, a method that defines multiple quantization levels with nested quantization grids, and progressively refines all latents from the coarsest to the finest quantization level. To achieve finer progressiveness in between any two quantization levels, latent elements are incrementally refined with an importance ordering defined in the rate-distortion sense. To the best of our knowledge, PLONQ is the first learning-based progressive image coding scheme and it outperforms SPIHT, a well-known wavelet-based progressive image codec.}

  abstract = {Most of the existing deep learning based end-to-end image/video coding (DLEC) architectures are designed for non-subsampled RGB color format. However, in order to achieve a superior coding performance, many state-of-the-art block-based compression standards such as High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC/H.265) and Versatile Video Coding (VVC/H.266) are designed primarily for YUV 4:2:0 format, where U and V components are subsampled by considering the human visual system. This paper investigates various DLEC designs to support YUV 4:2:0 format by comparing their performance against the main profiles of HEVC and VVC standards under a common evaluation framework. Moreover, a new transform network architecture is proposed to improve the efficiency of coding YUV 4:2:0 data. The experimental results on YUV 4:2:0 datasets show that the proposed architecture significantly outperforms naive extensions of existing architectures designed for RGB format and achieves about 10% average BD-rate improvement over the intra-frame coding in HEVC.}

  abstract={In this work, we propose a new recurrent autoencoder architecture, termed Feedback Recurrent AutoEncoder (FRAE), for online compression of sequential data with temporal dependency. The recurrent structure of FRAE is designed to efficiently extract the redundancy along the time dimension and allows a compact discrete representation of the data to be learned. We demonstrate its effectiveness in speech spectrogram compression. Specifically, we show that the FRAE, paired with a powerful neural vocoder, can produce high-quality speech waveforms at a low, fixed bitrate. We further show that by adding a learned prior for the latent space and using an entropy coder, we can achieve an even lower variable bitrate.},

Our method yields competitive MS-SSIM/rate performance on the high-resolution UVG dataset, among both learned video compression approaches and classical video compression methods (H.265 and H.264) in the rate range of interest for streaming applications. Additionally, we provide an analysis of existing approaches through the lens of their underlying probabilistic graphical models.Finally, we point out issues with temporal consistency and color shift observed in empirical evaluation, and suggest directions forward to alleviate those.},

  abstract = {We propose an algorithm, guided variational autoencoder (Guided-VAE), that is able to learn a controllable generative model by performing latent representation disentanglement learning. The learning objective is achieved by providing signal to the latent encoding/embedding in VAE without changing its main backbone architecture, hence retaining the desirable properties of the VAE. We design an unsupervised and a supervised strategy in Guided-VAE and observe enhanced modeling and controlling capability over the vanilla VAE. In the unsupervised strategy, we guide the VAE learning by introducing a lightweight decoder that learns latent geometric transformation and principal components; in the supervised strategy, we use an adversarial excitation and inhibition mechanism to encourage the disentanglement of the latent variables. Guided-VAE enjoys its transparency and simplicity for the general representation learning task, as well as disentanglement learning. On a number of experiments for representation learning, improved synthesis/sampling, better disentanglement for classification, and reduced classification errors in meta learning have been observed.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a novel pipeline for automatic grammar augmentation that provides a significant improvement in the voice command recognition accuracy for systems with small footprint acoustic model (AM). The improvement is achieved by augmenting the user-defined voice command set, also called grammar set, with alternate grammar expressions. For a given grammar set, a set of potential grammar expressions (candidate set) for augmentation is constructed from an AM-specific statistical pronunciation dictionary that captures the consistent patterns and errors in the decoding of AM induced by variations in pronunciation, pitch, tempo, accent, ambiguous spellings, and noise conditions. Using this candidate set, greedy optimization based and cross-entropy-method (CEM) based algorithms are considered to search for an augmented grammar set with improved recognition accuracy utilizing a command-specific dataset. Our experiments show that the proposed pipeline along with algorithms considered in this paper significantly reduce the mis-detection and mis-classification rate without increasing the false-alarm rate. Experiments also demonstrate the consistent superior performance of CEM method over greedy-based algorithms.},

  abstract={This paper introduces Phase Selective Convolution (PSC), an enhanced convolution for more deliberate utilization of activations in convolutional networks. Unlike conventional use of convolutions with activation functions, PSC preserves the full space of activations while supporting desirable model nonlinearity. Similar to several other network operations, e.g., the ReLU operation, at the time of their introduction, PSC may not execute as efficiently on platforms without hardware specialization support. As a first step in addressing the need for optimization, we propose a hardware acceleration scheme to enable the intended efficiency for PSC execution. Moreover, we propose a PSC deployment strategy, with which PSC is applied only to selected layers of the networks, to avoid excessive increase in the total model size. To evaluate the results, we apply PSC as a drop-in replacement for selected convolution layers in several networks without affecting their macro network architectures. In particular, PSC-enhanced ResNets achieve higher accuracies by 1.0-2.0% and 0.7-1.0% on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, respectively, in Pareto efficiency. PSC-enhanced MobileNets (V2 and V3 Large) and MobileNetV3 (Small) achieve 0.9-1.0% and 1.8% accuracy gains, respectively, on ImageNet at little (0.2-0.7%) total model size increase.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we characterize the throughput of a broadcast network with n receivers using rateless codes with block size K. We assume that the underlying channel is a Markov modulated erasure channel that is i.i.d. across users, but can be correlated in time. We characterize the system throughput asymptotically in n. Specifically, we explicitly show how the throughput behaves for different values of the coding block size K as a function of n, as n approaches infinity. Under the more restrictive assumption of memoryless channels, we are able to provide a lower bound on the maximum achievable throughput for any finite values of K and n. Using simulations we show the tightness of the bound with respect to system parameters n and K, and find that its performance is significantly better than the previously known lower bound.},

In this paper, we develop a novel anonymous-query based rate control, which approaches the optimal throughput with a constant feedback overhead independent of the number of receivers. In addition to our theoretical results, through implementation on a software-defined ratio platform, we show that the anonymous-query based algorithm achieves low-overhead and robustness in practice.},
