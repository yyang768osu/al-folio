Hi there!  I am a sophomore studying Mathematics and Computer Science at Cornell University where I'm fortunate to be working with with [Abe Davis](http://abedavis.com) on Computer Graphics and Machine Learning research.  

My research focuses on using mathematical tools and machine learning to find useful representations of real-world object 
that can capture not only the shape, but also the dynamics of the real world. Currently, I am interested in 3D shape representation, reconstructions, and various deep learning approaches for object and scene re-simulation.
