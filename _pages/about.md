I work as Sr. Staff Deep Learning Engineer at [Qualcomm AI Research](https://www.qualcomm.com/research/artificial-intelligence/ai-research?cmpid=fofyus221808&gclid=Cj0KCQiA0p2QBhDvARIsAACSOOM3Dpz826NbHIO_FaBcb4FDeoXz0nVAd4w5zkCrpDe2F_V2syhq07waAs3VEALw_wcB) in San Diego. My research interests include deep generative models, neural data compression (image/video/speech compression), and machine learning for combinatorial optimization (e.g., graph-level compiler optimization). I am passionate about designing deep learning solutions to challenging problems and deploying them to edge devices. 

I received my Ph.D. from the Ohio State University in 2015 on wireless networking. Before joining AI Research, I worked on wireless physical layer design (reference signal, channel estimation, tracking loop), channel coding design, and standardization for 5G NR.
